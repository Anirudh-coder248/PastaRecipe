Put water in a big bowl and put it on the stove and turn the stove on, when the water is boiling add pasta in the bowl and wait for the pasta to be smooth but not squishy. Then take the pasta out of the big bowl and put the pasta in a bowl with tiny holes at the bottom so that the pasta will not have water in it, In the same bowl that was used to boil the water put oil and your vegetables on it than wait for the vegeteables are done cooking. Put the past on the bowl that has the vegetables and mixe everything toghether than add the tomato sauce and mix everything together and then wait till everything is cooked a mixed together. That is how you make pasta.
